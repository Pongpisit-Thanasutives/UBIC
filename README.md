# [UBIC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10401233) (Uncertainty-penalized Bayesian Information Criterion)
Official code implementation of the uncertainty-penalized Bayesian information criterion (UBIC) originally proposed in [Adaptive Uncertainty-Penalized Model Selection for Data-Driven PDE Discovery](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10401233).

- Please first install our modified pysindy package archived at [this OneDrive link](https://1drv.ms/u/c/39cecf604f8b30de/Ed4wi09gz84ggDl7AAAAAAABgZ89ebMdSRESd2a8jiF01w?e=6m0EXl) (Password: UBIC). The more updated version is avaiable at [this repository](https://github.com/Pongpisit-Thanasutives/pysindy).
- Please visit [the Example directory](Examples/) to run experiments.
- To use the L0BnB best-subset solver, please install [the package](https://github.com/Pongpisit-Thanasutives/l0bnb).

## Note
[UBIC-play](https://github.com/Pongpisit-Thanasutives/UBIC-play) and [PDE-FIND](https://github.com/Pongpisit-Thanasutives/PDE-FIND) are the development versions used to produce recent results in the paper. I occasionally conduct some experiments in [UBIC-test](https://github.com/Pongpisit-Thanasutives/UBIC-test).
