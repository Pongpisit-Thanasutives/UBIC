# UBIC
Official code implementation of the uncertainty-penalized Bayesian information criterion (UBIC) originally proposed in "[Adaptive Uncertainty-Guided Model Selection for Data-Driven PDE Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10283)".

- Please first install our modified pysindy package archived at [this OneDrive link](https://chula-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/pongpisit_t_alumni_chula_ac_th/EX7weU9tSe9BtbQjJXrGQG0Bxlj8d-nkEK6DZYsvLXbjhw) (Password: UBIC).
- Please visit the Example directory to run experiments.
